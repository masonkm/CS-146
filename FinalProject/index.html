		<h1>Net Neutrality</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Net neutrality is a term that refers to a set of rules that were implemented by the FCC to maintain equality online for all users. This means that large corporations will not be given priority with bandwidth or speed. It also means that internet service providers(ISPs), such as Verizon and AT&T cannot throttle internet speeds, or charge extra for certain internet packages in way similar to cable. Soon after the Trump administration named Ajit Pai the chairman of the FCC, he announced his plan to repeal title II of the Communications act, stripping internet users of many of their online rights, and giving more power to corporation ISPs. </p>
