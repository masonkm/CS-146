		<h1>Net Neutrality Opposition</h1>
		<p>There are many organizations currently in opposition to net neutrality. ISPs such as Comcast are prominent among them, as they don't want to lose out on the money of the people they will charge for tiered services. Some key net neutrality opponents are Comcast, IBM, Intel, Cisco, AT&T, and a group called Hands off the Internet.</p>
		<p>The FCC, the committee overseeing net neutrality, is slightly tilted towards opposing it. Three members are opposed to it as compared to two who are for it.</p>
		<p>Ajit Pai, the current chairman of the FCC, is a lawyer who previously worked for Verizon. He is strongly opposed to net neutrality, and is the biggest threat to it as of today.</p>
		<p>Many bot accounts have been created by Comcast/other ISPs to send in anti-net-neutrality comments to the FCC.</p>
		<p>Recently many members of congress acceted large, or even rather small, donations from ISPs in an effort to buy their vote against Net Neutrality and sell out their constituents. There was a total of 265 members of congress that were practically paid off by ISPs. Of these 265, all belonged to the republican party. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15100620/congress-fcc-isp-web-browsing-privacy-fire-sale">Click here for a full list</a> of congressmen who sell out their constituents for a quick buck. </p>
