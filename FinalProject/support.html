		<h1>Support Net Neutrality</h1>
		<p>Net neutrality and freedom on the internet is essential in the modern world. In fact the UN includes access to the internet in its definition of basic human rights. The repeal of net neutrality would not only infringe upon that right, it would also give corporations like Verizon and AT&T unprecedented power over the internet, which would result in the internet being sold as cable it today. The internet should not be sold in packages and bundles at a more expensive price, everyone should have equal access to the information online. </p>
		<p>It is now more important than ever to make your voice heard and to protect the internet, as the FCC has called for a vote to repeal net neutrality on December 14th. If their plan passes then the internet as we know it will be changed forever. Take action now!</p>
