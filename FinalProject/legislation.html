		<h1>Net Neutrality Legislation</h1>
		<p>A common debate in legal circles about net neutrality is whether ISPs should be classified as "common carriers" or not. A common carrier, in legal terms, is usually either an entity that carries goods or provides a public utility. Common carriers are forbidden from discriminating based on the customer or type of goods. If ISPs were to be classified as common carriers, net neutrality would come as a matter of course, due to the ISPs being unable to treat certain customers differently.</p>
		<p>ISPs are not currently considered common carriers.</p>
		<p>Many attempts at legislation for net neutrality have been made, but most have failed or been struck down. The most relevant piece of legislation is the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009. It "makes it the duty of each Internet access service provider to: not block, interfere with, discriminate against, impair, or degrade the ability of any person to use an Internet access service; not impose certain charges on any Internet content, service, or application provider; not prevent or obstruct a user from attaching or using any lawful device in conjunction with such service, provided the device does not harm the provider's network; offer Internet access service to any requesting person; not provide or sell to any content, application, or service provider any offering that prioritizes traffic over that of other such providers; and not install or use network features, functions, or capabilities that impede or hinder compliance with these duties."</p>
